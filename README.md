## Project Overview

**SheConecta** is a mobile app designed to boost the personal and professional growth of young women in STEM by providing mentorship, networking, and collaboration opportunities.  

**Goal**: Close the gender gap in STEM through connection, guidance, and inclusive project spaces â€” aligned with **SDG 5** (Gender Equality) and **SDG 9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

## The Problem

According to **UNESCO (2023)**, only **35%** of STEM students globally are women. Many female university students face:

- Lack of access to mentors
- Few role models
- Limited networking and project collaboration opportunities

**SheConecta** addresses this with a safe and smart platform to match students and mentors based on their interests, fields, and goals.
